Single-target
-------------

This is the "CS-J-CS-X-CS-ShoR" rotation theorycrafted by Theck on Maintankadin 
forums. X is either AS or HW. This rotation is commonly known as "939". It does 
not suggest Hammer of Wrath when the target is low on health because there is no
theorycrafting for that yet.

Note: you won't see Consecration or Idle slots in your queue unless you start
using  your abilities at wrong times.

AOE
---

Same as above, except CS is replaced with HotR. Theorycrafting for AOE rotations 
hasn't been done yet, but this rotation seems to work reasonably well (especially 
since Inquisition isn't available until Cataclysm).

Future changes (awaiting theorycrafting)
----------------------------------------

* Using HoW in single-target rotations
* Using Inquisition in AOE rotation
* Possibly a completely different AOE rotation once Theck gets around to
  simulating it :)
