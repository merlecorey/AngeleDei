Single-target
-------------

This is the "CS-J-CS-X-CS-ShoR" rotation theorycrafted by Theck on Maintankadin 
forums. X is either AS or HW. This rotation is commonly known as "939". When the
current target is low on health the addon starts suggesting Hammer of Wrath,
resulting in "CS-J-CS-HoW-CS-SHoR".

Note: you won't see Consecration or Idle slots in your queue unless you start
using your abilities at wrong times.

AOE
---

Same as above, except CS is replaced with HotR and Hammer of Wrath is not used.
Still waiting for theorycrafting for AOE rotations that use Inquisition. In the
meantime, this rotation seems to work reasonably well.

Future changes (awaiting theorycrafting)
----------------------------------------

* Still waiting on info for Cataclysm-style AOE rotations
