Single-target
-------------

This is the "CS-J-CS-X-CS-ShoR" rotation theorycrafted by Theck on Maintankadin 
forums. X is either AS or HW. This rotation is commonly known as "939". When the
current target is low on health the addon starts suggesting Hammer of Wrath,
resulting in "CS-J-CS-HoW-CS-SHoR".

If your settings prioritize Consecration, X will be AS, Consecration or HW.
If you don't prioritize Consecration, you shouldn't Consecration slots.

Prioritizing Consecration when you don't have Hallowed Ground will not improve
your DPS, but your rotation will be quite a bit more mana-intensive.

Prioritizing Consecration when you DO have Hallowed Ground will improve your 
DPS by about 0.6%.

Note: you won't see Idle slots in your queue unless you start using your 
abilities at wrong times.

AOE
---

If you don't prioritize Consecration, you will get a variant of 939 in which CS
will be replaced by HotR (a.k.a. "9H9"): "HotR-J-HotR-X-HotR-ShoR". X is either 
AS or HW.

If you do prioritize Consecration, you'll get a more poweful and MUCH more
mana-intensive rotation: HotR>Cons>HW>AS>ShoR>J. Using it without the Hallowed
Ground talent will probably drain your mana very quickly.
